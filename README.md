## Code
This repository contains the code published alongside with our UIST 2019 [paper](https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2019/computationalMR/downloads/computationalMR_preprint.pdf). It is organised as follows: [`2D_playground`](2D_playground) contains an example of a 2D UI that is optimized using integer linear programming based on adjustable parameters. [`3d_comp_mr`](3d_comp_mr) contains Unity and Python scripts to run the optimization in real time. Please refer to the READMEs in the respective subfolder for more details.
